DESCRIPTION
    This command, like its sibling "dumpphases", exists to help make
    understanding what is going on in "Dist::Zilla" a little easier.

    At least, having this command means debugging certain kinds of problems
    is more obvious.

    If you want to see all plugins that are adding files to your dist?

        dzil dumpwith -FileGatherer

    Though, of course, this requires some knowledge of what roles are
    applicable.

    If you want to turn colors off, use "Term::ANSIcolor"'s environment
    variable "ANSI_COLORS_DISABLED". E.g.,

        ANSI_COLORS_DISABLED=1 dzil dumpphases

    Alternatively, specify a color-free theme:

        dzil dumpwith -VersionProvider --color-theme=basic::plain
