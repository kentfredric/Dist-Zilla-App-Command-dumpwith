DESCRIPTION
    Working out what Plugins will execute in which order during which phase
    can be a little confusing sometimes.

    This Command exists primarily to make developing Plugin Bundles and
    debugging dist.ini a bit easier, especially for newbies who may not
    fully understand Bundles yet.

    If you want to turn colors off, use "Term::ANSIcolor"'s environment
    variable "ANSI_COLORS_DISABLED". E.g.,

    "ANSI_COLORS_DISABLED=1 dzil dumpphases"

    Alternatively, since 0.3.0 you can specify a color-free theme:

        dzil dumpphases --color-theme=basic::plain
