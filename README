Dist::Zilla::App::Command::dumpwith

This command, like its sibling "dumpphases", exists to help make
understanding what is going on in "Dist::Zilla" a little easier.

At least, having this command means debugging certain kinds of problems
is more obvious.

If you want to see all plugins that are adding files to your dist?

    dzil dumpwith -- -FileGatherer

Though, of course, this requires some knowledge of what roles are
applicable.

If you want to turn colors off, use "Term::ANSIcolor"'s environment
variable "ANSI_COLORS_DISABLED". E.g.,

    ANSI_COLORS_DISABLED=1 dzil dumpphases

Alternatively, specify a color-free theme:

    dzil dumpwith --color-theme=basic::plain -- -VersionProvider
